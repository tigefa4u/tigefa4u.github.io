# Mention.js

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/pCvqL.png">

Lightweight (min: 1.92kb, full: 4.07kb) wrapper for adding @user mention functionality to Twitter Bootstraps Typeahead plugin.

This enables you to have Twitter-like user mentions in textareas

<b>View the demo <a href="http://jakiestfu.github.com/Mention.js/" target="_blank">here</a>.</b>

## Dependencies

* <a href="https://github.com/jquery/jquery" target="_blank">jQuery</a>
* <a href="https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap" target="_blank">Typeahead</a>

## Usage
The `users` parameter accepts an array of objects. Each object ***must*** have a username key in order for this script to work.

{% highlight javascript %}
$("#multi-users").mention({
    delimiter: '@',
    users: [{
        username: "ashley"
    }, { 
        username: "roger"
    }, { 
        username: "frecklefart123"
    }]
});
{% endhighlight %}

## Sensitivity

{% highlight javascript %}
$("#multi-users").mention({
    sensitive: true,
    users: [{
        username: "sarah"
    }, { 
        username: "bigRat"
    }, { 
        username: "roger"
    }, { 
        username: "Ricky"
    }]
});
{% endhighlight %}

With sensitivity set to true, items are ordered by the following divisions of priority:

* Highest: If first letter matches exactly
* High: If first letter matches regardless of case
* Med: If target has matching letters' case
* Low: if target has matching character regardless of case

### Sensitivity Examples:

If you were to query `"@r"`, with sensitivity on, the resulting list will be `["roger", "Ricky", "sarah", "bigRat"]`, but if you were to query `"@R"`, the resulting list would be `["Ricky", "roger", "bigRat", "sarah"]`


## Full Names, Images, and Query By
If you have a `name` and/or `image` key in one of your user objects, there name and image will appear as such in the dropdown list.

The `queryBy` parameter accepts an array of strings that represent keys in your user object that you would like to query against. For example, if you were to type in the `name` "@Scott", the script would match the `username` "@bigCat". `username` is required for this script to work.

{% highlight javascript %}
$("#multi-users").mention({
    queryBy: ['name', 'username'],
    users: [{
        username: "sarah",
        name: "Sarah Jones",
        image: "http://placekitten.com/25/25"
    }, { 
        username: "bigCat",
        name: "Scott Pfaff",
        image: "http://placekitten.com/25/25"
    }, { 
        username: "coderDude",
        name: "Roger Penn",
        image: "http://placekitten.com/25/25"
    }]
});
{% endhighlight %}

## Empty Querying

You may query for users simply by pressing your delimiter. For example, pressing the @ symbol will return all users that are a part of your users list, so long as those users adhere to the `typeaheadOpts.items` limit

{% highlight javascript %}
$('#multi-users').mention({
    emptyQuery: true,
    typeaheadOpts: {
        items: 10 // Max number of items you want to show
    },
    users: [...]
});
{% endhighlight %}


## Defaults

{% highlight javascript %}
$("#multi-users").mention({
    users: [], // Array of Objects
    delimiter: '@', // Username Delimiter
    sensitive : true,
    queryBy: ['name', 'username'],
    typeaheadOpts: { // Settings for Typeahead
        matcher: _matcher, // Mention.js's custom matcher function, don't change
        updater: _updater, // Mention.js's custom updater function, don't change
        sorter: _sorter, // Mention.js's custom sorter function, don't change
    }
}); 
{% endhighlight %}
