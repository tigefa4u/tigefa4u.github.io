Django Blog Zinnia
==================

Simple yet powerful and really extendable application for managing a blog
within your Django Web site.

Zinnia has been made for publishing Weblog entries and designed to do it well.

Basically any feature that can be provided by another reusable app has been
left out.
Why should we re-implement something that is already done and reviewed by
others and tested ?
