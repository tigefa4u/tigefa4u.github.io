Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory (representing the raw form of a website),
runs it through Textile or Markdown and Liquid converters, and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server.
This is also the engine behind
<span class="label label-info">[GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com)</span> which you can use to host your project's page or blog right here from GitHub.
