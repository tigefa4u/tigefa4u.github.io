Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory (representing the raw form of a website), 
runs it through Textile or Markdown and Liquid converters, and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server. 
This is also the engine behind
