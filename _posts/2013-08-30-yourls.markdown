This Github repo is automatically synced to the official YOURLS [SVN repo](http://yourls.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/) (trunk) when a new commit is pushed.

For now, the development will _not_ happen here. For more information, see [this blog post](http://blog.yourls.org/2012/08/should-yourls-be-on-github-instead/).
