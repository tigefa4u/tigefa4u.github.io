Have you ever written your own __rake tasks__? If you write them very often this post will be very usefull for you. I won't describe what is __rake task__ here because there are a lot of information about it yet. I will tell you how to easy _generate_ __rake task__.

Today I found interesting generator in __Ruby On Rails__. I have never read about it in any post, doc, book or tutorial, I have never seen it in any sceencast, I've never heart about it from any podcast and I wondered that Google doesn't tell me nothing about it. So I decided to write about it here.

If you want to write your own __rake task__ you have 2 ways to do it (I thought so beafore):

1. Write it from scratch
2. Copy-paste code from another ready __rake task__ and change code to required

But there is a 3rd way to do it. Just use this __rake generator__:

	$ rails g task my_namespace my_task1 my_task2
	$ create lib/tasks/my_namespace.rake

It will generate scaffold for our new __rake task__:
>lib/tasks/my_namespace.rake

{% highlight ruby %}
namespace :my_namespace do
  desc "TODO"
  task :my_task1 => :environment do
  end

  desc "TODO"
  task :my_task2 => :environment do
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

It is awesome! And now you can write here your code for new __rake tasks__.

Let's make sure these __rake tasks__ are exist and we are able to use them:

	$ rake -T | grep my_namespace
	rake my_namespace:my_task1  # TODO
	rake my_namespace:my_task2  # TODO

Perfect! As you can see it is very easy to write your own __rake task__. It is easier as you do it before. Thanks for reading!
