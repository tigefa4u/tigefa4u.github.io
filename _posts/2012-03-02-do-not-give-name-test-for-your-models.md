There is a list of reserved words for Ruby On Rails framework. Full list is [here](http://oldwiki.rubyonrails.org/rails/pages/ReservedWords).
But it doesn't contain at least one word which I will describe in this post. There are many reasons to don't give name **Test** for your _models_ in _Ruby On Rails_.
I will try to describe in this post problems which you will have if you have _model_ with **Test** name.

![Do not give name Test for your models](/images/do_not_give_test_name_for_models.jpg)

Let's start with creating new application:

    ~$ rails new test_app --skip-test-unit --old-style-hash --skip-javascript --skip-bundle --skip-git
    ~$ cd test_app
    ~/test_app$ bundle install

Make _models_ **Test** and **TestPart**:

    test_app$ rails g model test name:string
    test_app$ rails g model test_part name:string test_id:integer
    test_app$ rake db:migrate


## Reason 1: Test is not a class. It is a module!

I want to debug my code. So I'm going to _rails console_ by typing **rails c** in terminal and trying to
find all **Test** instances in my _database_ (I did't create one that way I have to get blank _collection_):

    irb(main):001:0> Test.all
    NoMethodError: undefined method `all' for Test:Module

What is happened? I'm trying to get all _tests_ in my _db_ but I get error instead of empty _collection_.
We will find out for this question in _rails console_:

    irb(main):002:0> Test.class
    => Module

This is a _module_ but not a _class_ how we expected. _Module_ **Test** exist in **TestUnit** and even we aren't using
**TestUnit** in our application we will have this confusion. To avoid this negative situation we can rename _class_ **Test** to
**MyTest** for example. Let's do it manually:

    test_app$ mv app/models/test.rb app/models/my_test.rb

Remember if we have _model_ **MyTest** it would connect with _table_
**my_tests** but we don't have this _table_. So we have 2 ways to solve this problem:

1. Rename _table_ **tests** to **my_tests**. We should create new migration to do it
2. Set custom _table name_ for _model_ **MyTest**. In our case it is **tests**

I will use 2nd variant because it will take less time:

> app/models/my_test.rb

{% highlight ruby %}
class MyTest < ActiveRecord::Base
  self.table_name = 'tests'
end
{% endhighlight%}

> You must use here **self.table_name** but not **table_name =**. It won't give expected effect in another case.

Try to test what we did and how it works now:

    {{ruby}}
    irb(main):003:0> reload! # we have changes in code so we have to reload console to get changes here
    irb(main):004:0> MyTest.all
      MyTest Load (0.1ms)  SELECT "tests".* FROM "tests"
    => []

And, yes! It's working now correctly!

## Reason 2: validates uniqueness in scope

Assume **MyTest** has_many **TestPart**s and **TestPart** belongs to **MyTest**:

> app/motest/test_part.rb

{% highlight ruby %}
class TestPart < ActiveRecord::Base
  attr_accessible :name, :test_id
  belongs_to :test, :class_name => 'MyTest'
end
{% endhighlight %}

> app/models/my_test.rb

{% highlight ruby %}
class MyTest < ActiveRecord::Base
  attr_accessible :name
  self.table_name = 'tests'
  has_many :test_parts, :foreign_key => 'test_id'
end
{% endhighlight %}

Check it out:

    irb(main):009:0> reload!
    irb(main):010:0> t = MyTest.new(:name => 'My first test')
    => #<MyTest id: nil, name: "My first test", created_at: nil, updated_at: nil>
    irb(main):011:0> t.test_parts.build(:name => 'Test part 1')
    => #<TestPart id: nil, name: "Test part 1", test_id: nil, created_at: nil, updated_at: nil>
    irb(main):012:0> t.test_parts.build(:name => 'Test part 2')
    => #<TestPart id: nil, name: "Test part 2", test_id: nil, created_at: nil, updated_at: nil>
    irb(main):013:0> t.save
    => true
    irb(main):014:0> t.test_parts
    => [#<TestPart id: 1, name: "Test part 1", test_id: 1, created_at: "2012-03-02 22:49:51", updated_at: "2012-03-02 22:49:51">, #<TestPart id: 2, name: "Test part 2", test_id: 1, created_at: "2012-03-02 22:49:51", updated_at: "2012-03-02 22:49:51">]

Perfect! Everything is working.

Let's try to add validation for test parts name's uniqueness in scope **test_id**:

> app/motest/test_part.rb

{% highlight ruby %}
class TestPart < ActiveRecord::Base
  attr_accessible :name, :test_id
  belongs_to :test, :class_name => 'MyTest'
  validates :name, :uniqueness => {:scope => :test_id}
end
{% endhighlight %}

Try to save the same test partials to my test:

    irb(main):016:0> reload!
    irb(main):017:0> t = MyTest.create(:name => 'My second test')
    => #<MyTest id: 2, name: "My second test", created_at: "2012-03-02 23:06:30", updated_at: "2012-03-02 23:06:30">
    irb(main):018:0> t.test_parts.build(:name => 'Test part')
    => #<TestPart id: nil, name: "Test part", test_id: 2, created_at: nil, updated_at: nil>
    irb(main):019:0> t.test_parts.build(:name => 'Test part')
    => #<TestPart id: nil, name: "Test part", test_id: 2, created_at: nil, updated_at: nil>
    irb(main):020:0> t.save
    => true
    irb(main):021:0> t.test_parts
    => [#<TestPart id: 3, name: "Test part", test_id: 2, created_at: "2012-03-02 23:06:56", updated_at: "2012-03-02 23:06:56">, #<TestPart id: nil, name: "Test part", test_id: 2, created_at: nil, updated_at: nil>]

Ooops! We have trouble here. We added _uniqueness validation_ for _name_ field _test parts_ and we should able to save **only one** test part with
same name for _my test_. But... we did it!

To fix this problem we have 2 ways:

1. Rename table **tests** to **my_tests** and remove line `self.table_name = 'tests'` from `app/models/my_test.rb`
2. Rename colum **test_id** to **my_test_id** and fix code according this changing: use everywhere **test_id** instead of **my_test_id** in application

I think it is very important to find this bugs in your application before you started write it and use in production. So I hope these rails confusions
described in my post will help you to avoid problems with coding in the future.

That's it what I wanted to tell you today. See you in next posts!
