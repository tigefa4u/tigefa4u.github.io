Hi!

Thanks for downloading this icon set. This set is still in its first version. 
If you have any comments, suggestions, or requests for specific icons, 
please post it under this post: http://itscoding.com/new-social-media-icon-set or write to me at: admin@itscoding.com

License: well, I don't really like it when I see licenses that force me to give a backlink. So, feel free to use this icon set without any restrictions. 
However, I would really appreciate it if you could link to me or post a link to your project where you have used these icons under this link: http://itscoding.com/new-social-media-icon-set .. 
However, this is not required :) .. and yah, please do NOT sell them as your own!

So, good luck with your project!

Have a great day/night/evening/....!
